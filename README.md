# IMDB_Classification
Family Friendly Productions, a movie production company, wants to increase their overall movie revenue in 2024 financial year. The production company saw that IMBD provides classifications for new movies so the company wants to know if there is a faster and more accurate way to predict what movie the new movies they have coming in 2024 will be categorized before it hits market in order to ready their user base earlier in marketing. The goal of this project then is to design a deep learning neural network model based on movie poster image data to classify the movie genre so that Family Friendly Productions can market their new movies faster and increase 2024 movie revenue.
