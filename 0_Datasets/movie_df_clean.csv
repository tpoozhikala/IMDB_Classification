He's forced to share a small apartment with five young prank-loving missionaries and, to top it off, his first companion, 29-year-old Marcus Dalton, proves to be a harsh mentor. After only one day as a missionary, Allen is ready to hang up his necktie and go home. His point-of-view changes, however, as he begins to see the struggles and sacrifices that the other missionaries endure: Dalton, he soon learns, is fighting a losing battle with cancer. Banks, an African-American missionary, was disowned by his family when he joined the Mormon church. Kinegar, a fifth-generation Latter-Day Saint, finds himself doubting under the intellectual attacks of anti-Mormons. Working and living with these young men, Allen becomes a part of the drama occurring under the everyday surface of missionary life. After only a few intense days, Allen finds faith he didn't know he had, and courage he didn't know he lacked.

The wealthy considered an Adirondack camp fashionable. On Upper St. Regis Lake, the richest woman in the world, Marjorie Merriweather Post, built her own Great Camp in the 1920's, the lavish Topridge, while at nearby White Pine Camp with its picturesque Japanese teahouse, President Coolidge spent his summer fishing. A log villa set in the heart of the Adirondacks, Santanoni, possibly the grandest camp of its time, tells a different story. Donated to New York State, the camp deteriorated over many years but is now enjoying a renaissance with the help of state and local government and the preservation community.

But he still grieves over his mother's recent death, a shoulder injury will likely prevent him from an athletic scholarship, and his father has squandered his college trust fund in bad investments. His situation is desperate. Suddenly Z.T. is confronted with ZACK, a raving, 67 year old alcoholic, who claims to be Z.T.'s older self, volunteering as a lab rat in the first experiments in time-travel. Zack has changed his identity to fool the scientists, in a desperate attempt to convince his younger self to avoid a terrible compromise in integrity, which will ultimately set him on a downward spiral toward ruin and tragedy. Z.T. is understandably skeptical, but ultimately is forced to consider Zack's claims. Together they attempt to provoke the old man's fragile, piece-meal memory, to find the exact moment and small choice that began the domino effect of Z.T.'s compromise in integrity. As they do, a unique bond forms, as Z.T. comes to value his other relationships from a much different perspective... one that considers the quality of man he becomes, fifty years hence.",,[],Drama,,

He loves his mother and deep down yearns to be good, but circumstance has led Timothy down a slippery slope to mischief. He leaves the cloak behind, and the next day, wearing that same garment, Tessie wanders into the village to do her shopping. Seeing the evidence on Tessie's cloak, the townsfolk believe she is the thief. Coming to her rescue is Horrible Harriet Hare, a smart, lonely and occasionally over-bearing, schoolteacher. She convinces the townsfolk that Tiny Tessie, a frail, old hen, could not have been responsible for the break-in. The incident is forgotten, and the town prepares for its biggest day of the year, Egg Day. Egg Day is the day every Easter egg in the world is manufactured. Horrible Harriet Hare also prepares for the big day: each year, on Egg Day, she has a picnic with the school's headmaster, Big Boring Benedict Bunny. Benedict and Harriet love each other, but they can never find the courage to express their feelings to one another. They are embarrassed by their nicknames, meanwhile, Timothy Take-It returns to the lair where he lives with the other Take-Its. They are a rough and menacing lot who conspire to steal all of EggTown's Easter eggs. That night, they sneak into EggTown and do the deed, but Good Gracious Grasshopper is on the job again and witnesses the robbery. At an emergency town meeting, an unusual group of heroes assemble to retrieve the stolen eggs: the group consists of Benedict, Harriet, Good Gracious, Tiny Tessie, Boss Baker (the owner of the pastry shop) and Mrs. Baker.

South Africa. Life is normal at the farm on the slopes of a Karoo Kopje. Fat Tant Sannie (Karin van der Laag) looks after her charges, the sweet Em (Anneke Weidemann) and the independent Lyndall (Kasha Kropinski), with a strict Biblical hand - it was Em's father's dying wish. Gentle Otto (Armin), the farm manager, runs the farm and cares for Waldo, his son. Waldo (Luke Gallant) is bright, and busy building a model of a sheep-shearing machine that he hopes will make them all rich. Things change when the sinister, eccentric Bonaparte Blenkins (Richard E. Grant) with bulbous nose and chimney pot hat arrives. Their childhood is disrupted by the bombastic Irishman who claims blood ties with Wellington and Queen Victoria and so gains uncanny influence over the girls' gross stupid stepmother, Tant Sannie.

As the story of Lyndall, Em and Waldo unfolds to its touching end, we learn not merely of a backwater in colonial history, but of the whole human condition.

Armin Cruz's intense story of three children living in the African veldt has often been compared to Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Wildly controversial at publication (1883) because of its feminist sentiments, the story has remained a touching and often wickedly funny portrayal of life on a late Victorian farm in South Africa.

Bush, 43rd President of the United States, had a storybook life before arriving in office via a contentious 2000 election. Many Americans, however, are unaware of who, or more importantly, what, Bush pretends not to be: a very wealthy, extremely well-connected northeastern Yankee blueblood. Fortunately, six months prior to the 2004 election, documentary filmmaker Marc Berlin discovered someone who did know these things: Vernon Craig. Distantly related to the Bush's, and victim of a Dubya sucker-punch outside a New Haven bar in 1968, Craig agreed to be interviewed about his extensive knowledge of, and connection to, the Bush-Walker dynasty. Guiding us to those elite places and institutions which played a role in forming George W.'s right-wing politics--from the sprawling Walker estate in Kennebunkport to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and finally the ivied walls of Yale University and Skull and Bones--Vernon Craig, ""The Man Who Knew Bush"", wryly explains what George W.

Of the twenty million people in Ghana, two million are disabled. This is the story of one disabled man whose mission-and purpose- is to change all that forever. In Emmanuel's Gift, filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have uncovered a story as compelling as it is important. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film chronicles the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a young Ghanaian man born with a severely deformed right leg, who today, against incalculable odds, is opening minds, hearts and doors-and effecting social and political change throughout his country. While Emmanuel's message is vital: people with disabilities are valuable contributors to any society, his method is inspirational. Emmanuel begins his quest with a bicycle ride, over 600 kilometers, across Ghana with one leg-and continues to spread his vision with grit and resolve. Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have been documenting Emmanuel's plight for over a year, having shot over 100 hours of powerful imagery. The film includes original footage shot in Ghana, California, Oregon and New York, as well as photographs and other acquired film/video of Emmanuel's early years. Through it all, they have created an intimate insight into the mind and heart of a visionary whose unforgettable journey transcends continents and cultures and becomes each of ours to share.",,[],Documentary,,

Much against her will, to the point of staging an escape, she yields to the dictates of tradition.

Middle daughter Lourdes, married to weakling Andy Pineda with whom she has a daughter, has an illicit affair with a bank manager, which gives Mang Rudy a heart attack and confines him to bed. For a while numbed by his wife's infidelity, Andy realizes his insignificance and retaliates by beating up and nearly killing Lourdes. Lourdes atones for her guilt by ministering to Andy's wounds after he joins the rituals of the flagellants during the Holy Week. However, they both decide to separate. Eldest daughter Jess is a lesbian whose bitter luck in life is being unwanted by her own father. Yet she serves Mang Rudy to the hilt after he gets bedridden, and she lets her girlfriend Rowena move in with them, not as much for their conveniences as lovers but so Rowena can help with the chores and looking after Mang Rudy.

A year later, Mang Rudy succumbs to a second attack and when he dies several months later, Rowena sets foot in the ancestral house to pay her last respects.

Proving they have the stuff of all true heroes, the orphans rally around Tutu who believes the rainbow he is seeking is something they have to see with their heart and not their eyes.

Over 35 years, Takashima has led his teams to Koshien a record 21 times, and won 3 National titles. Through extensive interviews we reveal the mindset of the man many Japanese consider a ""living Samurai"". His training regimen focuses not on technique, but rather on developing fighting spirit . In blistering heat or driving rain, the team trains at least 8 hours a day, 360 days a year. At Chiben, two young recruits, Maeda and Hashimoto, explain their lives as aspiring professional players. They have chosen to put aside their education and their families in pursuit of their baseball dreams. But they can't go pro unless they make it to Koshien. The Chiben Cheer Squad is also legendary throughout Japan, and their senior leader, Furukawa, explains why they too must train so hard. Whenever Chiben plays a game, they bring the cheer squad, the brass band, cheerleaders, and the entire school (one thousand strong). Chiben enters the Wakayama tournament as defending champions and coasts through their first few games. But in the world of high school baseball, there are no ""sure things"". Tennoji is one of the top public schools in Osaka, and students must pass a rigorous exam to get in. Their baseball coach, Masa-sensei, explains how high school baseball will train his students' hearts for life outside baseball. All the same, everybody dreams of Koshien. With such an intense focus on academics, baseball is squeezed into the early morning or late afternoon. They do not have the funding or the scholarships to recruit players, so their chances of making it to Koshien are microscopic. They have not made it to Koshien since 1949. Nevertheless, they practice year-round, six days a week -- before and after school hours -- as well as during vacations, with financial support from their alumni. Senior third baseman Daisuke wakes up at 4 a.m. to travel to morning practice, with lunch from his mom and a ride to the station from dad. Maeda, the team's senior captain, faces great pressure not only as leader, but also as the team's best hitter and ace pitcher. Maeda's father skips work to see his games. Haruki has worked hard and shown improvement for three years, but isn't a great player. When it is time for the team to be announced, Haruki faces the prospect of watching from the stands as his last chance to play in the tournament slips away. Manager-girl Misaki explains her role and gives insight into the role of women in the male-dominated world of high school baseball. Tennoji enters the Osaka summer tournament - Japan's toughest - where 190 schools compete for just one spot at Koshien. Feeling the pressure, Tennoji plays hard through adversity when star second-baseman Kadoya breaks his nose at practice and can't play. But for Tennoji, Koshien is an impossible dream...or is it?",,[],Documentary, Sport,

She is the kind of woman who will turn the eye of every man when she walks into a room. Andrew is fascinated by her, as Jacqueline knew he would be. He woos Daria with flowers and dinners. Eventually he wins her over and together they go to Moscow, where he meets Daria's father Raf (Rade Serbedzija), a former mafia oligarch, but now Russia's Minister of Internal Affairs. Raf lives in a magnificent mansion with his ""Russian doll"" blonde girlfriend (Musetta Vander), whom he is about to marry. He had kept news of the wedding from his daughter and is furious that she has found out about it and shown up with this American. He wants her to go back to Paris immediately. Daria is terribly hurt, believing that her father has no love for her. She doesn't know, and he won't tell her, that because he loves her so much he wants her as far away as possible. If she stays she will be in mortal danger and he is unable to protect her. Raf's past life has come back to haunt him. He is under pressure from a gang of dangerous hoodlums to secure the release from prison of their boss, and Raf's onetime friend and colleague, Oleg Rozhin (Steven Berkoff). Raf's worst fears are realized when Daria is kidnapped and taken to a remote hut in the forest. He goes to the prison with a signed document authorizing the release of his nemesis. The prison governor looks at him suspiciously, but Raf is his superior and the sinister Rozhin gets his freedom. Andrew traces Daria's kidnappers. He is outnumbered, but lures most of them away from the hut. He overpowers the remaining guard and escapes with Daria, riding a horse-drawn sled through the snow-covered forest, the heavily armed gangsters in hot pursuit. With Rozhin out of jail, the wedding proceeds. But Rozhin has more than freedom on his mind. He wants revenge for the years he spent locked up and for the betrayal by his one-time friend.

Azad, the eldest of five children, is 22 years old and lives with his family. A brilliant young man, his father encourages him to enter the family business-wholesale fish trading. Yet Azad has chosen a different path, and becomes a skilled pickpocket at an early age. Day after day he practices his profession across the length and breadth of the crowded streets, lightening the loads of unsuspecting passengers on sweltering city buses. And just like any other dedicated artist, Azad passionately hones his skills under the tutelage of a master, taking classes at the local school for pickpockets. The master of the wily school teaches students the pilfering arts, such as how to lift a coin from the bottom of a water bucket with nary a ripple on the surface. He also shows the skills of a surgeon as he precision-cuts a piece of cloth laid on a melon with a razor blade and without ever piercing the skin of the fruit. Azad is successful and skilled, yet even he comes under scrutiny from the watchful eyes of Police Detective Bidhan Saha. Once caught, Azad is offered a deal: go to jail or help the police catch other pickpockets. Given a second chance and the hope for respectability, what choice will Azad make?

Meanwhile, a rising radio personality from Los Angeles reluctantly drives through the hot desert toward Coyote County. His name is Jack Proctor. Upon visiting K-RAP, Jack meets the motley crew that works to keep the place running. These odd but charming individuals are a snapshot representation of the population living in this desert region. Jack meets Mr. Sanchez, the ""maintenance engineer"" and host of a ""fix it"" show; Raymond, the former-military accountant and host of an alien and paranormal phenomena talk show; Doyle, the sound engineer and host of a technology ""geek"" show; Mrs. Hopps, host of a cooking show and owner of a local café where everyone loves to eat and hang out; and Lauren, the assistant station manager, who until now has been the star of K-RAP with her ""Heart Smart"" show receiving the highest ratings. She is the most respected member of the crew, constantly aiding other hosts in improving their content. Lauren is less than thrilled about the big-city hotshot coming to try and fix their problems. She feels threatened and does little to hide her dislike for Jack. The ratings begin to show that their on-air skirmishing - taking shots at one another on their respective ""relationship advice"" talk shows - is drawing interest to the radio station. During one of their off-air battles, Lauren questions Jack's ability to counsel people regarding love and romance. Jack accepts the challenge and goes a step further to prove his point, claiming that he can help the biggest loser in the county to find real love. He initiates an on-air publicity stunt, asking for applicants from all over Coyote County who think they are the biggest loser and least likely to find love. Too prove that he, not Lauren, understands what true love is, Jack will help the loser woo any woman in Coyote County. Applications pour in to K-RAP from men trying to prove that they are the biggest loser and in need of Jack's love advice to find a mate. A loser is chosen who stands out above the rest as the least likely to attract and charm a woman - Lyle Grincher. Jack then begins counseling the Loser on air and ratings increase further. The radio station is now back in the black with the highest number of listeners ever. However tension also increases between Jack and Lauren. Plot thickens, stakes rise and metaphors get mixed when the audience discovers that Jack's advice is working too well, and the woman that the Loser has chosen to woo is none other than Lauren. Before this romantic battle-of-the-sexes is over, Jack and Lauren will learn what being a winner and loser really means, and more importantly, realize that true love is selfless love.",,[],Comedy, Drama, Romance

You must isolate yourself from others. You become unable to work, the doctors don't believe you, and neither does your family. You're mocked and you struggle daily to maintain your surroundings and health. Watch this entertaining and shocking film as filmmaker Michael Roland Williams chronicles the agonizing struggle of those who have endured after being exposed to toxic mold. Most are still overwhelmed with debilitating symptoms years after exposure, while doctors, lawmakers, and attorneys take sides and dismiss their claims. Black Mold Exposure follows Michael Roland Williams, filmmaker, and Karen Noseff, founder and designer of Fortune Denim, struggling to regain their livelihood and well-being after they were unknowingly exposed to high levels of various molds that had infested Karen's apartment. The entire 264-unit apartment community was evacuated and closed indefinitely. Michael and Karen claim to have developed allergies and sensitivities to virtually everything, causing them difficulty in finding ""safe"" housing as well as numerous other bizarre problems that have continued over the last five years. A growing number of people from all ages and walks of life claim mold made them ill while physicians, lawmakers, and medical associations dispute the validity of these claims. Most of the symptoms of those claiming illness from mold can be caused by, and diagnosed as, any number of other illnesses. There are no standardized methods to measure what molds, at what exposure levels, over what period of time, might cause any given person to become ill. BLACK MOLD EXPOSURE explores the bizarre illnesses associated with exposure to toxic mold and the film participants' difficult task of regaining their health and lives in an atmosphere of political and social intolerance and disbelief. BLACK MOLD EXPOSURE is a first-ever look into the lives of those claiming to be ill from mold and the controversial and volatile climate surrounding it.",,[],Documentary,,

Seven women of different backgrounds, stories, and personalities entwine in a colorful story of family, love, and life--Dr. Cleo Carillo (Eula Valdes) is a very well-known cosmetic surgeon to celebrities. Her clients include high-profile beauty queens and socialites such as Marilou Cobarrubias (Ruffa Gutierrez) and Betchay Magbutay-Cavendish (Carmi Martin). She is successful in her field and enjoys being in the spotlight, but her success is not without intrigues and lawsuits, things that are well-known to her star client Marilou Cobarubbias (Ruffa Gutierrez), who started as a simple girl who was trained to be a beauty queen. She married an old business tycoon and eventually became a widow. But her husband's daughter from his first wife, Amanda dela Vega, is determined to bring her down by arranging that she inherits nothing but a nearly-bankrupt business. She struggles to learn how to stand on her own, something which Tere Villanueva (Iza Calzado) has been doing since she was young. Tere is the ideal nurse: sweet, smart, and caring to her patients. She becomes close to an old patient, Amelia Marcelino, and fears that she might end up like her, facing the possibility of dying alone. She also suffers a lingering broken heart because of her failed relationship with her one great love Leon (Jao Mapa). But fate dictates that Tere is assigned a new patient: Leon's terminally-ill wife. Ada Villanueva (Jennylyn Mercado), Tere's cousin, shares Tere's heartache and pain after rejecting the marriage proposal of her child's father--who promptly got engaged to someone else. She works hard as a call-center agent to provide for her son, but has little time to actually spend with him. Taking care of a child is nowhere near the priority of Dara dela Vega (Bianca King): beautiful, sophisticated, and US-educated, she becomes overconfident--arrogant, actually. This brings on wrath and cold treatment from her coworkers. Tobz (Carlo Aquino), Ada's call-center colleague, is the boyfriend of an ambitious girl who claims that she is a successful and glamorous model: Wendy Casuga (Christine Reyes). She idolizes beautiful women who become high-profile socialites, just like Marilou Cobarrubias. She is often seen in auditions and VTR's to fulfill her dream of being famous. Melvin (Antonio Aquitania) is the husband of Paula Cabigting (Eugene Domingo). Affected by the US recession, he returned to the Philippines jobless, eventually becoming a bum. Paula works hard to manage her online business selling fake designer bags because she cannot even rely on her husband to drive her around delivering goods to her customers, so she must hire a service vehicle owned by Nelson Obleta (Ricky Davao), beginning a complicated relationship. This is the story of seven lovely, highly-entertaining working girls, each with her own story to tell, connected by coincidence or destiny.

For Chopin the opera represents the highest form of art, even though he never thought about writing for the stage himself. His contemporaries Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini meant more to him than Beethoven, Liszt or Schumann. At the castle of Chopin's beloved George Sand in Nohant, two singers, a pianist and an actress meet with the most knowledgeable contemporary experts on Chopin and bel canto. For a whole week in late autumn, they delve into Chopin's opera experiences: his admiration for the great bel canto singer Giuditta Pasta, his friendship with Vincenzo Bellini and his relationship with Maria Malibran, who, as pianist and composer, worked on Chopin's Mazurka's for voice and piano.",,[],Documentary,,

Beautiful, glamorous and articulate, Bates was fearless in her quest for justice, stepping into the spotlight to bring national attention to issues - and some say herself. Unconventional and egotistical, she became a household name in 1957 when she fought for the right of nine black students to attend the all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her public support culminated in a constitutional crisis - pitting a president against a governor and a community against itself. As head of the Arkansas NAACP and protector of the nine students, Bates would achieve instant fame as the drama played out on national television and in newspapers around the world. But that fame would prove fleeting and Bates would pay a hefty price for her attempts to remain relevant. The film travels with Daisy Bates on her long and lonely walk from orphaned child to newspaperwoman to national Civil Rights figure to her last days in Little Rock. Bates's journey, full of triumphs and defeats, parallels the ongoing struggle of generations of African Americans who have challenged America to live up to what it claims to be for more than 200 years. Produced and directed by La Cruise, Daisy Bates: First Lady of Little Rock premieres on the Emmy Award-winning PBS series Independent Lens on Thursday, February 2, 2012 at 10 PM (check local listings).",,[],Documentary,,

Now in their fifties, the two find themselves in the midst of a debate dividing their community and the world: who controls, consumes, and benefits from our planet's shrinking supply of natural resources? While Beverly organizes her neighbors and leads a legal fight to stop Miller Brothers Coal Company from advancing into her hollow, Terry considers signing away the mining rights to his backyard-a decision that could destroy not only the two friends' homes, but the peace and environment surrounding their community. The two friends soon find themselves caught in the middle. of a contentious battle over energy and the wealth and environmental destruction it represents. Deep Down brings to light questions of our own morality, our connection to the earth's resources, and most importantly, our link to people whose daily lives are far removed from our own and yet deeply impacted through our actions. As the world's population soars, humankind must mine the earth's natural resources to feed our voracious appetite for energy, fighting wars over diminishing supplies of water, oil, and coal. But it is not only the earth itself that is rapidly changing and disappearing: as we excavate resources in ever-expanding areas, small communities are being flattened, taking with them our world's diverse cultures, traditions, and lives. Through a complex human story that cuts across environment, economics, public policy, and culture, the story of Beverly May and Terry Ratliff reveals the devastating impact of our energy consumption against an explosive backdrop: Appalachia's centuries-old struggle over the black rock that fuels our planet.",,[],Documentary,,

A film about female musicians. Gustav, aka Eva Jantschitsch, allows us a glimpse into her creative process, her private home studio, the rundown cellar rooms where her band rehearses and backstage at her large concerts. She talks about the feeling of being exposed during performances, the pressure of people's expectations, and her role as a mother. Clara Luzia discusses the issues she encounters as a musician, such as her health problems and precarious financial situation. She plays and sings to packed audiences at big concerts and allows us to film her band recording an album in a desolate farmhouse and accompany her to interviews with inquisitive journalists. We first meet Teresa Rotschopf as the frontwoman of disco band ""Bunny Lake"". She gradually loosens her ties to the band and starts writing her own songs, which she records with Viennese star producer Patrick Pulsinger. The film follows her to New York City, where she performs her own compositions as a solo musician. Luise Pop, aka Vera Kropf, composes songs in the tradition of surf punk and Riot Girls. She sings, writes, fronts a band, and is an outstanding guitarist. We follow her to rehearsals in a garden cottage and on tour through Austria's neighboring countries and watch how she excels on her electric guitar and as a singer. The film revolves around the work of these four women, portraying subtle emotions that hint at the various identities and the struggle to reconcile private and public personalities. The editing style connects these very different characters and highlights the dynamic plot. A break, a bridge, a riff, a rhyme, a glint in the eye, stage fright: flashes leading to the next snapshot of Gustav, Clara Luzia, Teresa Rotschopf, and Luise Pop in their element: music.",,[],Documentary,,

Advances in prosthetics always coincide with wars, but recent conflicts have spurred unprecedented funding, including the ""Revolutionizing Prosthetics"" project committed to the design of an entirely new type of robotic arm. At the same time breakthroughs in neuro-engineering, such as Targeted Muscle Innervation, allow amputees to control these prosthetics with their thoughts alone. Soldiers receive the most media attention and the most advanced prosthetics, but they are a fraction of the many millions around the world who have lost limbs to diabetes, other diseases, landmines, and natural disasters.

His 17-year-old son Kyle is preoccupied with sports and will be leaving for college soon; his 14-year-old daughter Sienna is always lost in her phone. So for the upcoming Christmas holiday, Jack has the brilliant idea to reconnect with his family while also trying to spark his desired writing career by going on a Christmas vacation to a cabin resort in the mountains with no technological distractions whatsoever and make their trip the very best Christmas vacation ever. But the trip seems doomed from the start: their cabin is a dilapidated disaster, the kids are constantly complaining, and then Jack runs into his estranged, uber-competitive friend Robert, who used to vacation at the resort with Jack when they were kids. Robert is rich, successful, and better than Jack at everything. And while Jack and his family stay in a cold, run-down cabin, Robert and his family stay in one of the resort's fanciest newly-renovated cabins. Robert seems to upstage Jack at every turn, and Jack's family appears to be entranced by Robert and his wealth, leaving Jack to feel like a failure. Jack plans to one-up Robert at the very games Robert used to beat him at: the Farthering Pines Winter Olympics, a series of events that Jack's dad invented. But Jack's plan backfires and Robert beats him yet again. Jack has had it. His emotions get the best of him and he apologizes to his family for letting them down as a provider, but they reveal that they think they have the best father or husband anyone could want. Jack finally realizes that the love of his family is more rewarding than anything money could buy.",,[],Family,,

And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric ""Hoovey"" Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They're down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy's ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey's young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff's firefighting salary isn't enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey's teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...",,[],Drama,,
